DP Sturcture

    1) Overlapping Subproblem
    2) Optimal Substructure Property


DP Example
    Maximizing or Minimizing value or Counting Problem 


DP Techniques
    1) Top Down ( Memoization )
        -> When every subproblem need not be solved at all
    2) Bottom Up ( Tabulation )
        -> When every subproblem must be solved at least once

1.
DP States
    ->  Decide state exp
2.
DP realtion
    -> Formulate transition relationships of exp
