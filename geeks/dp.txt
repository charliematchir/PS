DP Sturcture

    1) Overlapping Subproblem
    2) Optimal Substructure Property


DP Example
    Maximizing or Minimizing value or Counting Problem 


DP Techniques
    1) Top Down ( Memoization )
        -> When every subproblem need not be solved at all
    2) Bottom Up ( Tabulation )
        -> When every subproblem must be solved at least once


DP States
    ->  Decide state exp and Formulate transition relationships
