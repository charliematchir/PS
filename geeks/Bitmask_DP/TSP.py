'''
Given a 2D grid of characters representing 
a town where '*' represents the 
houses, '#' represents the blockage, 
'.' represents the vacant street 
area. Currently you are (0, 0) position.

Our task is to determine the minimum distance 
to be moved to visit all the houses and return
to our initial position at (0, 0). You can 
only move to adjacent cells that share exactly
1 edge with the current cell.
