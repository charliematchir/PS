single Source (src -> all)

Single Destination (all -> dst) (Dijkstra of rev_graph)

Single Pair ( src -> dst)

All pair (all -> all)



all 3 algorithm used for finding shortest path

Floyd Warshall ( all -> all )
    Edge weight Neg to Pos
    Won't work with neg cycle Graph ( dist[i][i] <0 -> Negative Cycle )
    O(V^3)
    Used when small V & E, but dense Graph

Dijkstra (src -> all)
    Edge weight only Pos
    O((V+E)LogV)


Bellman Ford (src -> all)
    Edge weight Neg to Pos
    Can detect Neg cycle in graph
    O(VE)



A* Algorithm (src -> dst)
    using Heuristic value
